# Architecture

Latticefolk separates **simulation truth** from **decision suggestions**.

## Core invariant

A decision provider is not authoritative over the world. It cannot teleport an NPC, invent inventory, bypass collisions, or directly mutate numeric state. It selects high-level intent from legal candidates; the simulation validates and executes the result.

This boundary makes remote decision models replaceable and allows the game to continue when a provider is unavailable.

## NPC decision cycle

1. Build an NPC-centric world snapshot.
2. Remove entities the NPC cannot perceive. In god mode, the player does not exist in the NPC snapshot.
3. Compute legal actions from current game state.
4. Ask the active `DecisionProvider` for bounded choices.
5. Reject stale responses using the perception epoch when camera/world semantics changed during an in-flight request.
6. Execute movement and action consequences through deterministic game systems.
7. Record short-term memory and schedule the next decision.

## Dialogue pipeline

The dialogue store can contain complete authored lines or `opener/body/closer` fragments. Local retrieval first narrows a large library by tags, role, mood, and intent. The decision provider sees only that bounded candidate set and selects IDs. It does not need access to the entire corpus.
